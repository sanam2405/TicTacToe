# TicTacToe

This is a clone of the famous Tic-Tac-Toe game. A 3x3 square grid is given. The player makes the first move (Cross) and correspondingly CPU makes a move (Circle). Random function is used to implement CPU moves and hence they might not always be the optimal move. The one to mark three cells of the same sign (Horizontally, Vertically or Diagonally) wins the game
